## Overview

Found this project on Kevin Powell's Youtube channel and thought it would be a great page to learn from as I have not built a full page like this with background elements.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

For this I followed along a tutorial to understand how to set up the basic webpage. I learned to start with utility classes and how to get things in place so it helps layout a page and duplicate it later on.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The importance of utility classes and working with pseudo styles.

### Continued development

### Useful resources
